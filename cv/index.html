			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p>China's developing subculture of music, art, and film has yet to really gain much recognition beyond its borders. With all the talk of China's financial dominance and impending rise to power, there seems to be relatively little discussion about the potential cultural impacts. Any possible cultural dialogue is likely handicapped by the fact that sites such as Youtube, Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, and other conventional avenues of connection and promotion are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China">blocked inside of China</a>. Caoker aims to position itself as the internationally-accessible analogue to these services, faciliating cultural exchanges. </p>
		<h3>Re-branding & Re-focusing</h3>
		<p>When I first arrived at the company, the site was completely different. The project was called "M-Digi" and had a business model that seemed dependent on pay-per-view concerts. The site also hoped to serve games, channel programming, and an e-commerce platform. As both lead designer and product manager, I re-focused the mission of the site and subsequently directed an overhauling of the branding and the site itself.
		<br /><br />
		A site aimed at appealing to the "hipster" ("文艺青年") demographic means that its branding must be memorable and cool. Like subculture scenes elsewhere in the world, China's is quite varied, ranging from metalheads to skateboarders to fashionistas and so on. I decided to develop the brand in a "cool-neutral" direction - that is, it retains recognizable and appealing features of a youth brand, while refraining from adopting any aspects that are deeply associated with a specific subcultural niche.</p>
		<h3>Here are some of the changes:</h3>
		<figure class="shot">
			<img src="/img/cv/expand/joinus.png" />
			<figcaption>A more brand-cohesive and friendly sign-up page, to encourage users to register. To keep from initimating the user, the form gradually reveals itself as the user fills in validated data.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure class="shot">
			<img src="/img/cv/expand/entrance.png" />
			<figcaption>Some features on the site require the user to login. If a user is not logged in and tries to use such a feature, they are immediately presented with this login form, streamlining the process. If the user has not yet registered, they can begin registration from this form.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure class="shot">
			<img src="/img/cv/expand/productdetail.png" />
			<figcaption>We wanted to make the mall section's seller panel powerful enough to accept stores of any kind, whether they be clothing stores, electronic stores, music stores, etc. We developed a custom "option" system where the seller can define different options (i.e. sizes, colors, formats, etc.) and then manage any combination of these options.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<br /><h6>If you are interested in reading some more detailed explanations of the design and branding decisions, read on...</h6><br />
		<h3>New Name</h3>		
		<p>The first major step to re-branding was changing the name. After much debate we decided on "草壳" because we anticipated our target demographic would really enjoy it. Literally, the name means "grass nutshell" - that is to say, it doesn't really mean anything at all. But the name is intended to function as an in-joke, playing on the fact that "草" (cǎo) sounds very similar to "操" (cào), which means "fuck" but is often used to express "wow"  or "cool". By using the same language that our demographic uses, and by showing that we aren't afraid to, we establish ourselves as equals and make it easier for them to connect with us.</p>  
		<figure class="logo"><img src="/img/cv/expand/caoker.png" /></figure>					
		<h3>New Logo</h3>		
		<p>In this case, I wanted something that embodied the following: the "newness" of the world that Chinese youth were experiencing as a part of a developing superpower, the expression of the creative communities that would be involved, and the "look-at-me" attraction Caoker would provide. In the end, the logo attempted to capture all that, with its smooth, plastic representing the "newness", the more playful type representing creative expression, and the bright blue as the eye-catching "look-at-me" factor.</p>
		<h3>New Site</h3>		
		<p>I oversaw the conversion of the existing platform into some more usable and appealing. The site aesthetic was changed to match the branding, vital missing features were designed and developed, and overall development of the major sections was more precisely planned out. We listened to user feedback and added many recommendations to build a feature-rich and intuitive experience for both Chinese and foreign users alike. As we were under a very tight timeframe, I personally implemented many of the front-end changes to assist in development.</p>

		<h3>Merging & Co-Presidency</h3>
		<p>While I was working at Penn Student Agencies, I approached my boss about starting a new student business that would aggregate the university's creative talent into a design agency. During my research, I found out that such an organization already existed as <a href="http://www.pennstudentdesign.com/">Penn Student Design</a>. I reached out to them about merging into Penn Student Agencies, which would provide them with funding, access to Penn Student Agencies' clients, and the legal protection that comes with being an official entity of the university, giving them significant leverage for dealing with defaulting or difficult clients.</p>
		<p>Penn Student Design took the opportunity and I joined as co-president, managing the merger in addition to handling some of the organization's outward-facing responsibilities, such as designer and client recruitment. </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/">Deerhaus</a> is an art collective (that ended up being more of a pseudo-record label) I began with Jake Baumohl in 2009. It essentially functioned as an entity to house our collaborations and encourage more cooperation with other artists and musicians in Philadelphia.</p>

		<h3>Beginnings</h3>
		<p>Deerhaus started with just <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jakebaumohl">Jake’s photography</a> and my music projects (<a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/law/">LAW</a>, <a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/ttp/">Tiger Tiger Panther</a>, and <a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/goldenages/">Golden Ages</a>), but eventually expanded to include <a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/sound/">bands</a> and <a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/visual/">visual artists</a> from Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and New York. Together we would book shows and parties, working closely with local venues and other Philadelphia/New York bands.</p>
		<h3>Chinese New Year</h3>		
		<p>In February 2011 we had our largest event, co-presented with music blog <a href="http://yvynyl.tumblr.com/">yvynyl</a>, a Chinese New Year celebration at a warehouse in Philadelphia. We booked <a href="http://sunairway.com/">Sun Airway</a>, <a href="http://celebrationelectrictarot.com/">Celebration</a>, and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/cslsx">CSLSX</a> in addition to having our own Golden Ages’ and <a href="http://www.deerhaus.com/savages">Savages</a> perform. For Deerhaus’s first (and only) large-scale show, it ended up becoming a surprisingly highly anticipated and <a href="http://www.phrequency.com/blog/music/Chinese_New_Year_at_the_Ox_Sun_Airway_Celebration_warm_up_chilly_warehouse_with_vibes.html">well-attended event</a>, with the warehouse venue selling out in advance.</p>
		<p>Although my personal involvement in Deerhaus slightened after my move to Beijing, the collective is still organizing events in Philadelphia and New York.</p>

		<h3>A Brief History</h3>			
		<p>Pi Lambda Phi, or "Pilam" as it was colloquially known, was renowned (notorious) on UPenn's campus for its very unconventional nature. It was respected by university leaders for its acceptance of and involvement in the LGBT community, as well as its women-friendliness (for being coed and safe). At the same time there was some concern for its rogue tendencies, as Pilam was known around Philadelphia for its involvement in the city's subculture, particularly for hosting CBGB-like shows. Every April for over 30 years, Pilam hosts its infamous "<a href="http://www.phrequency.com/blog/Energy_Rages_at_Human_BBQ_.html">Human Barbeque</a>" festival, featuring 15 bands in one day of non-stop music.</p><br /><br />

		</figure>
		<h3>Vice Presidency</h3>		
		<p>I joined Pilam at the end of my sophomore year, and was elected Vice President and Archon for my junior year. My responsibilities included managing these events as they happened, which often involved dealing with inebriated (or otherwise "altered") people, the police, and typically in the aftermath, university faculty. During my time as Vice President, we had shows that included bands such as <a href="www.subpop.com/artists/pissed_jeans">Pissed Jeans</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vile">Kurt Vile</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Energy_(band)">Free Energy</a>, <a href="http://netherfriends.bandcamp.com">Netherfriends</a>, and countless other groups. It was an amazing experience.</p>
