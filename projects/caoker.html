		<h4>Responsibilities as Product Manager</h4>			
		<p>As product manager for Caoker, I organized the product’s development and was deeply involved in both the design and development processes. I managed a small team of developers, in addition to also acting as the design lead for the project. Because of the small staff size, I would often also take on additional development responsibilities, mostly for the front-end.</p>
		<p>At the time of my arrival, there was an existing site under a different identity, with a somewhat different purpose, and part of my responsibility as the product manager was to shift gears and push the site into a more viable direction. As a result, much of the site had to be restructured or rebuilt from scratch. Caoker’s scope was large (seriously – encompassing several sections that could each exist as a standalone site), and restrictive timeframes meant our product development process had to be agile. This meant a lot of rapid iterations, constant usability feedback from users, and a lot of processes going in parallel. As my first product management position, diving right into such a fast-paced process wasn’t easy, but we managed to build a solid product in less than a year.</p>
		<p>Designing a service for both Western and Chinese populations proved to be a unique challenge. Members of a very different culture tend to have different intuitions about usability, and different tastes in general. Rather than a “one country, two systems” approach, we wanted to create a singular site experience that was appropriate for both cultures. I worked closely with Chinese members of our staff, and when possible, drew upon my own experience as a bicultural person to develop Caoker so that it was both usable and appealing for people of either background. The former goal (usability) mainly meant reducing elements to their culturally-neutral essence, which is a fascinating practice in understanding “universal” (i.e. cross-cultural) facets of design.</p>
		<p>Of course, we didn’t want the site to be neutral. We were targeting a very stylized subculture (hip youth) that, in many ways, spans both Chinese and Western cultures, so afterwards we would reapply some flavor (branding) geared towards this crowd.</p>

			<figcaption>The video player was designed to have a very clean and unobstrusive look, to allow the content to speak on its own.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="/img/design/caoker-videoplayer2.png" />
			<figcaption>The video information is found below the player. The full-browser design makes the whole viewing experience a lot more powerful, and feel more like a desktop application rather than a website.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="/img/design/caoker-register.png" />
			<figcaption>In order to encourage user registration, the registration page was designed to be as unintimidating as possible. The copy and imagery are meant to be very friendly and inviting. I also implemented a gradually revealing form, so that the user isn't initially off-put by a large amount of fields. As the user inputs validated information, the next fields reveal themselves.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="/img/design/caoker-entrance.png" />
			<figcaption>Some features on the site require the user to login. If a user is not logged in and tries to use such a feature, they are immediately presented with this login form, streamlining the process. If the user has not yet registered, they can begin registration from this form. The design is meant to be reminiscient of the actual registration and login pages.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="/img/design/caoker-musicplayer.png" />
			<figcaption>The music player is a relatively simple device, not requiring much space. I used the excess space in this full-browser interface as crossfading ad space (here, it's displaying photos). The music player itself can also be branded.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="/img/design/caoker-productdetail.png" />
			<figcaption>Caoker also allows boutiques and other small stores to sell merchandise on the site. Since we couldn't anticipate exactly what types of stores would sign up, I designed a flexible system that allows sellers to manage products of many different attributes (i.e. size, colors, shape, and so on).</figcaption>
