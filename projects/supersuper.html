	<p class="summary">SUPERSUPER DB was an album leak database I developed and maintained in 2009 after Sordo DB (temporarily) went offline. The backend was written in PHP.	</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.sordomusic.com/db/">Sordo DB</a>, the model that SUPERSUPER was based off of, was a music album leak database. If an album leaked, someone would upload it and release the download link to Sordo DB, where others could grab it. It was a great way of keeping up with new music, an excellent exploration tool for the curious music fan. I found it to be better than following MP3 blogs and other conventional music outlets; you’d be among the first to hear a big band’s new album by watching Sordo DB.</p>

	<p>Sometime in 2009, Sordo DB went offline and gave no indication of returning. I developed SUPERSUPER as a replacement. It was very similar to Sordo DB in features, but I went my own way with the design, keeping it clean and minimal.</p>

	<p>At that time I only had very basic PHP experience but ended up building the site from scratch on my own, teaching myself some more advanced things on the way. The first version went up and caught on quickly as the “official” replacement for Sordo DB, especially after the original operator of Sordo sent me his good wishes and the old Sordo database backup files.</p>

	<p>As the operator of SUPERSUPER, I was <a href="http://flagpole.com/Weekly/Features/TheRiseOfDigitalDistribution-23Dec09">interviewed in a December issue of the Athens, GA alt-weekly “Flagpole”</a> about my thoughts on digital distribution in the aughts. I think I mistakenly assumed that sites like mine broke album leaks before other networks, which probably isn’t true.</p>

	<p>After some time, Sordo returned and I stopped actively maintaining SUPERSUPER. I checked in on the site a couple months later and came to see that it had been taken over by pharmaceutical spam bots.</p>

	<p>At that point I decided to pull the plug on the project.</p>
