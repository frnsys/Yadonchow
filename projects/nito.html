		<h4>Send secrets in plain sight</h4>			
		<p>NITO is intended for <em>hidden-in-plain-sight</em> communications. The originally considered context was message boards (forums) that might be monitored or otherwise restrictive. NITO allows the forum participants to trade messages that would normally be censored, without raising the suspicion of forum monitors. The encoded images are so subtly altered from their original images that it is unnoticeable in most cases.</p>

		<h4>Lock them with shared knowledge</h4>				
		<p>Text messages are encoded into an image by writing the text data as pixels. The specific patterns of the encoding are based on a keyword(s) chosen by the person transmitting the message. This keyword is the “context key”. The context key is never written down or transmitted, and instead <em>exists in the shared knowledge</em> of the message transmitter and receiver. Some examples of a “context key” would be an inside joke between the transmitter and receiver, or an mundane object that holds special meaning because of a shared experience between the two.</p>

			<figcaption>Text messages are encoded as hexadecimal colors. Depicted is the first encoded pixel of the message "Hello".</figcaption>		
		</figure>
		<h4>Store them as inconspicuous pixels</h4>
		<p>With most images, the original and the encoded image will be <em>nearly indistinguishable</em>. The best images to use are those that are noisier, without many solid colored surfaces. Images with a lot of solid black, for instance, aren’t a good choice.</p>
