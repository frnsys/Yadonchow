					<h2>Video Player</h2>
					<p>The video player was designed to have a very clean and unobstrusive look, to allow the content to speak on its own. </p>

					<h2>Video Player</h2>
					<p>The video information is found below the player. The full-browser design makes the whole viewing experience a lot more powerful, and feel more like a desktop application rather than a website.</p>

					<h2>Registration</h2>
					<p>In order to encourage user registration, the registration page was designed to be as unintimidating as possible. The copy and imagery are meant to be very friendly and inviting. I also implemented a gradually revealing form, so that the user isn't initially off-put by a large amount of fields. As the user inputs validated information, the next fields reveal themselves. </p>

					<h2>In-Page Login & Registration</h2>
					<p>Some features on the site require the user to login. If a user is not logged in and tries to use such a feature, they are immediately presented with this login form, streamlining the process. If the user has not yet registered, they can begin registration from this form. The design is meant to be reminiscient of the actual registration and login pages.</p>

					<h2>Music Player</h2>
					<p>The music player is a relatively simple device, not requiring much space. I used the excess space in this full-browser interface as crossfading ad space (here, it's displaying photos). The music player itself can also be branded. </p>
				</figcaption>


			<img src="/img/design/caoker-productdetail.png" />
				<figcaption>
					<h2>Seller Panel</h2>
					<p>Caoker also allows boutiques and other small stores to sell merchandise on the site. Since we couldn't anticipate exactly what types of stores would sign up, I designed a flexible system that allows sellers to manage products of many different attributes (i.e. size, colors, shape, and so on). </p>
