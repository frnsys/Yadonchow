				<h2>Ping Pong (乒乓)</h2>
						<p> With Ping Pong, the user could “pong” their own thoughts, and “ping” to retrieve a selection of others’ pongs. As you favorite the pongs you receive, Ping Pong’s backend would learn to recognize which types of pongs you might like. Thus, as you use the service more, the pings you receive become increasingly tailored to your tastes.</p>
